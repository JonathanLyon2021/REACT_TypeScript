# REACT_TypeScript
This is a REACT app I'm building using TypeScript. 

Creating a react app that includes TypeScript(tsx) instead of JavaScript(jsx syntax) you use this command: 

    npx -create-react-app "Name of your project" --template typescript
    
In order to run this REACT program you need to be in the correct directory and run:

    npm start
